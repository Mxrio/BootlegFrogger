# BootlegFrogger
CSE165 Final Project

To do:

Create a "Frogger.cpp" file with a corresponding .h that inherits from "GenericGame" and privately inherits from "Timer".

Figure out a structure for the objects that are going to be used.
- Different types of vehicles/obstacles (spawn location, spawn rate)
- The player controlled frog (distances, animations, speed, etc...)
- The GUI for the time remaining and lives left 
- How the board is set up (either a grid, or just a bunch of designated rows, etc...)
- Endgame/Goal (Simply to get to the next level, fill all 4 spots, indefinite, etc...)
